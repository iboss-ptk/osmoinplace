# osmoinplace

Utility for setting up osmosis in-place testnet for development and testing.
The usual flow requires too much manual process and stitching together of commands, this utility aims to reduce the friction to get a local testnet with mainnet state up and running.

## TODO

- [] add magic command to perform all setup at once
- [] add onready command
- [] add docs on usage
